Rails Integration for TinyMCE
=============================

The `tinymce-rails` gem integrates the [TinyMCE](https://www.tiny.cloud/) editor with the Rails asset pipeline.

This gem is compatible with Rails 5.0 and higher.

This is the branch for TinyMCE 3.5.x. Please see the [`main`](https://github.com/spohlenz/tinymce-rails) branch for TinyMCE 7, and alternate branches for [TinyMCE 6](https://github.com/spohlenz/tinymce-rails/tree/tinymce-6), [TinyMCE 5](https://github.com/spohlenz/tinymce-rails/tree/tinymce-5) & [TinyMCE 4](https://github.com/spohlenz/tinymce-rails/tree/tinymce-4).

**New in 3.5.11, 4.1.10 and 4.2.1:** Alternative asset installation methods (copy vs compile/symlink). See the [Asset Compilation](#asset-compilation) section below for details.

Instructions
------------

**1. Add `tinymce-rails` to your Gemfile**

```ruby
gem 'tinymce-rails'
```

Be sure to add to the global group, not the `assets` group. Then run `bundle install`.


**2. Create a `config/tinymce.yml` file with your global configuration options:**

```yml
theme_advanced_toolbar_location: top
theme_advanced_toolbar_align: left
theme_advanced_statusbar_location: bottom
theme_advanced_buttons3_add:
  - tablecontrols
  - fullscreen
plugins:
  - table
  - fullscreen
```

The Rails server no longer needs to be restarted when this file is updated in development mode.

To define multiple configuration sets, follow this syntax (a default configuration must be specified):

```yml
default:
  theme_advanced_toolbar_align: left
  theme_advanced_buttons3_add:
    - tablecontrols
  plugins:
    - table

alternate:
  theme_advanced_toolbar_location: top
  theme_advanced_toolbar_align: left
  theme_advanced_buttons3_add:
    - tablecontrols
  plugins:
    - table
```

See the [TinyMCE 3 Documentation](https://www.tiny.cloud/docs-3x/reference/Configuration3x/) for a full list of configuration options.


**3. Include the TinyMCE assets**

Use *one* of the following options to include TinyMCE assets.

(1) Add to your application.js:

```js
//= require tinymce
```

or (2) with jQuery integration:

```js
//= require tinymce-jquery
```

(3) The TinyMCE assets can be included on a per-page basis using the `tinymce_assets` helper:

```erb
<%= tinymce_assets %>
#=> <script type="text/javascript" src="/assets/tinymce.js">
```

**4. Initialize TinyMCE**

For each textarea that you want to use with TinyMCE, add the "tinymce" class and ensure it has a unique ID:

```erb
<%= text_area_tag :content, "", :class => "tinymce", :rows => 40, :cols => 120 %>
```

or if you are using Rails' form builders:

```erb
<%= f.text_area :content, :class => "tinymce", :rows => 40, :cols => 120 %>
```

Then invoke the `tinymce` helper to initialize TinyMCE:

```erb
<%= tinymce %>
```

Custom options can be passed to `tinymce` to override the global options specified in `config/tinymce.yml`:

```erb
<%= tinymce :theme => "simple", :language => "de", :plugins => ["inlinepopups", "paste"] %>
```

Alternate configurations defined in 'config/tinymce.yml' can be used with:

```erb
<%= tinymce :alternate %>
```

Manual Initialization
---------------------

Using the `tinymce` helper and global configuration file is entirely optional. The `tinyMCE.init` function can be invoked manually if desired.

```erb
<%= text_area_tag :editor, "", :rows => 40, :cols => 120 %>

<script type="text/javascript">
  tinyMCE.init({
    mode: 'textareas',
    theme: 'advanced'
  });
</script>
```

Language Packs
--------------

See the [tinymce-rails-langs](https://github.com/spohlenz/tinymce-rails-langs) gem for additional language packs for TinyMCE. The `tinymce` helper will use the current locale as the language if available, falling back to English if the core language files are missing.


Asset Compilation
-----------------

Since TinyMCE loads most of its files dynamically, some workarounds are required to ensure that the TinyMCE asset files are accessible using non-digested filenames.

As of tinymce-rails 3.5.11, 4.1.10 and 4.2.1, two alternative asset installation methods are available, which can be changed by setting `config.tinymce.install` within your `config/application.rb` file. Both methods are called when you run `rake asset:precompile` (via `Rake::Task#enhance`) after the regular application assets are compiled.

The default method, `copy`, copies the TinyMCE assets directly into `public/assets` and appends the file information into the asset manifest.

```ruby
config.tinymce.install = :copy
```

The new method, `compile`, adds the TinyMCE paths to the Sprockets precompilation paths and then creates symlinks from the non-digested filenames to their digested versions.

```ruby
config.tinymce.install = :compile
```

Due to compilation times, this method is only recommended using Rails 4 and up. This method is intended to eventually become the default, so please try it if it suits your environment and report any issues.

If you are including TinyMCE via `application.js` or using the `tinymce_assets` helper, you do not need to manually alter the precompile paths. However if you wish to include `tinymce-jquery.js` independently (i.e. using `javascript_include_tag`), you will need to add it to the precompile list in `config/environments/production.rb`:

```ruby
config.assets.precompile << "tinymce-jquery.js"
```


Custom Plugins & Skins
----------------------

To use custom plugins or skins, simply add the files to your asset load path so that they are locatable at a path beneath `tinymce/plugins/` or `tinymce/themes/advanced/skins/`.

For example, a plugin called `mycustomplugin` could have its main JS file at `app/assets/javascripts/tinymce/plugins/mycustomplugin/editor_plugin.js`.

You should also ensure that your custom paths are added to the asset precompile paths.


Using tinymce-rails as an Engine Dependency
-------------------------------------------

Ensure that you explicitly require `tinymce-rails` within your engine file. Including tinymce-rails as a dependency in your gemspec is not enough.


Updating
--------

When new versions of TinyMCE are released, simply update the `tinymce-rails` gem to the latest version. There is no need to run any extra rake tasks (apart from `rake assets:precompile`).
